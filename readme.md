# Flask REST API Project

This is a RESTful API built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Marshmallow, using SQLite as the database. It also includes OpenAPI documentation for easy understanding and usage of the API endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for building web applications.
- SQLAlchemy: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for Python, providing a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns.
- Marshmallow: An ORM/ODM/framework-agnostic library for converting complex datatypes, such as objects, to and from Python data types.
- SQLite: A C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database.
- OpenAPI: A specification for machine-readable interface files for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.
